# To-Do-list-Pyhton-program
A simple To-Do List Application written in Python, designed to help users manage daily tasks. Users can add, view, remove tasks, and optionally mark tasks as completed or pending.

## Features
### Add Task
Users can add a task to the to-do list. Each task will initially be marked as "pending."

### View Tasks
Users can view all tasks in the list along with their current status (either "Pending" or "Completed").

### Remove Task
Users can remove a task from the list by specifying the task number.

### Mark Task as Completed/Pending
Users can toggle the status of a task (mark it as "completed" or "pending").

### Exit
The program runs continuously until the user chooses to exit.

### How It Works
The application works in a loop where users are presented with a menu of options. They can interact with the to-do list by selecting options to add, view, remove, or update tasks. The list of tasks is displayed with their status.

The tasks are stored as dictionaries inside a list, where each dictionary contains:

name: The name of the task.
completed: The status of the task (either True for "completed" or False for "pending").
